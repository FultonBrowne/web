title: 'Ara alpha nine, an overview'

---
Well Ara has hit alpha 9, it includes full voice features , but there's still a lot to be done for alpha 10.

  the ara client needs local skills support, this is for platform specific things such as:
- phone calls
- text messages
- opening apps
- on device skills from external apps
I also need to get the ara IOT repo working, this will include a simple voice interaction and key word detection service, all of witch is run on a raspi.

well that will rap up today's post, see you soon
