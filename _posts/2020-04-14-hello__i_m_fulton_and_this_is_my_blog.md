title: 'Hello, I''m Fulton and this is my blog'

---
Hello, and welcome to my blog. I am Fulton Browne, A full stack developer who works on open source projects. I use, and therefore will write about Kotlin (my personal favorite), Java, JS, swift, and dart. The technologies I will be writing about, at least initially, include AI (all categories and flavors) , cross platform apps, and block-chain. I will also write about my personal ideas and projects, I will frequently have an idea that is, well, great but I simply don't have the time, skills, or money to pull them off, I will write about these ideas in hope that someone will be inspired and build them. the ultimate goal of this blog is to make my little bit of the word - my area of expertise a better place.

You may be wondering what experience I have. I am currently working on several open source projects of my own, including Ara, Solar Flare, and Warp. Ara is by far the most finished with solar flare in second, and to be honest I haven't touched warp in a while. because of the fact I am relatively new to programming (2 years in the books so far) those are the only big projects I have worked on, though I have contributed to several open source projects and built some smaller utilities and tools for fun.

Some non programming things to know about me. I live in the Portland Oregon area, I am coffee snob, and love R.E.M's music.

In closing, I hope you enjoyed this first post. if you want you can buy me a coffee https://www.buymeacoffee.com/28EcqNL or help support me by buying some of the computers I am selling on ebay https://www.ebay.com/itm/Dell-precision-3610-16-gigs-ram-6-core-zeon-e5/153834910618 that would be awesome, I hope to write a post about once a week, so see you then :]
